# pdf2csv

PDF2CSV is a web application designed to allow you to take PDFs that have tabular data present in them, like spreadsheets, tables, or ledgers and extract that data to convert it into a CSV.

## Using

Navigate to the [Login Page](https://pdf2csv.projecttiy.com/login) and sign in. If you do not remember your password, you can use the "Forgot Password?" button to reset your password.

After signing in, click on the blue PDF to CSV Button to get started. From there, select the correct PDF type, upload your PDF, and then click the blue Convert button.

If the conversion was successful, you will be presented with a download link that will last for 4 hours, after which the link will expire and the CSV will be removed. Uploaded PDFs are never kept or stored on the server and are deleted as soon as the upload completes.
